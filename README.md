# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the classification of Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal and sepal dimensions. The dataset used is the classic **Iris dataset**, a foundational dataset in machine learning and data science.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features. This project explores data preprocessing, visualization, and the application of various classification algorithms.

# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the classification of Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal and sepal dimensions. The dataset used is the classic **Iris dataset**, a foundational dataset in machine learning and data science.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its features. This project explores data preprocessing, visualization, and the application of various classification algorithms.

Results
Achieved an accuracy of [X%] using the best model.
Observed the following insights:
Sepal dimensions appear less discriminative compared to petal dimensions, though slight variations exist.
Petal Length (PetalLengthCm) is the most important feature
There seems to be a positive correlation between petal length and petal width, suggesting that as petal length increases, petal width also tends to increase.
In conclusion, the confusion matrix demonstrates that the model has achieved excellent performance on the Iris dataset. It can accurately classify Iris species based on the given features.

Visualizations
1. Matplotlib
Pairplot (Scatter Plot Matrix): This is a great tool to visualize the relationships between each pair of features in the dataset.
Histogram: Useful for visualizing the distribution of each feature (e.g., Sepal length, Sepal width).
Box Plot: Box plots are used to show the distribution of data based on five statistics (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum).
Bar Chart: Useful to show the count of flowers per species.
2. Seaborn
Heatmap: Visualize the correlation between features using a heatmap.
Pairwise Relationships: Seaborn’s pairplot is an excellent tool for visualizing pairwise relationships between variables.
